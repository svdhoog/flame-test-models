"Reserved variable names" for FLAME

If the variables (double) x,y, or z are present in a model, these are reserved for position.

In parsed C code: readAgentXML, line 416:

If x or y or z are present:
	
	posx = (double)current_Household_agent->x;
	posy = (double)current_Household_agent->y;
	posz = (double)current_Household_agent->z;

If one is not present, the respective posX variable is set to 0.0.
